# A Better Way to Run Christina's Child Care

## For Ophelia & Stephen

## The Problem You're Living With

Right now, running Christina's means juggling:

**Too many tools that don't talk to each other**
- QuickBooks for some things, but not everything
- Teaching Strategies that nobody really uses
- Brightwheel features you're paying for but not using
- 15-20 spreadsheets scattered across computers
- Paper forms, sign-in sheets, and sticky notes

**Too many outside people who don't know your business**
- Tech support that treats you like a ticket number
- Training vendors with generic content
- Software companies that don't care if you succeed

**Too much time on things that should be simple**
- Payroll takes hours instead of minutes
- Lesson planning eats up Christina's evenings
- Parent questions require phone calls and hunting for information
- Keeping track of certifications and compliance is stressful

**Estimated monthly spend on all these fragmented tools: $550-1,230**

And when Brooklyn Park opens? You'd need to set up and pay for everything all over again.

## What If Everything Just Worked?

Imagine one system where:

- **All the information is in one place** — attendance, staff schedules, payroll, lessons, parent communication, compliance tracking
- **Anyone can find what they need** — staff check their schedules on their phone, parents see their child's day, Christina sees the whole picture
- **It's built for how YOU run the business** — not some generic daycare software, but exactly what Christina's needs
- **One person supports it who actually cares** — family, not a help desk

That system exists. It's built. It's ready.

## What This Means Day-to-Day

### Before and After

| The Task | How It Works Now | How It Could Work |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Running Payroll** | 4-6 hours of gathering timesheets, checking math, entering into QuickBooks | 30 minutes — staff clock in/out digitally, system calculates everything |
| **Planning a Lesson** | 45-60 minutes researching, writing, formatting | 30 seconds — AI generates a complete lesson, ready to print |
| **CACFP Meal Tracking** | Daily manual tallies, monthly reports | Automatic — counts as kids eat, generates reports |
| **Parent Asks "How's my kid?"** | Find the right staff member, look up notes, call back | Parent checks the portal anytime, sees photos, reports, messages |
| **New Staff Training** | External vendor, schedule around their availability | Built-in training hub — new hires learn on their schedule |
| **Tracking Certifications** | Spreadsheet that needs manual updating | Automatic alerts before anything expires |
| **Building Staff Schedule** | Email chains, text messages, confusion | Visual calendar, drag-and-drop, staff see it instantly |

**Time saved: 12-16 hours every single week**

That's Christina getting her evenings back. That's you not worrying if something slipped through the cracks.

## Why This Is Different

### Not Another Subscription
Software companies want your monthly payment. They don't care if you actually use it or succeed with it. This is different — it's an investment in your business from someone who wants to see Christina's thrive.

### Built Specifically for Christina's
This isn't generic daycare software with 100 features you'll never use. Every page, every button, every report was built for how Christina's actually operates.

### Family Support
When something needs to change or a question comes up, you're not calling a help desk overseas. You're talking to Josh, who knows your business, your staff, and your goals.

### Brooklyn Park Ready
The system already supports multiple locations. When Brooklyn Park opens, it's ready — no extra setup, no extra cost, no extra headaches. Same login, instant access to both buildings.

Stop paying for 5+ tools you half-use. One platform, one relationship.

**Save Time Every Day**

**Look Professional**
Parents see a modern center with a real parent portal. That builds trust and referrals.

**Train Staff Consistently**
Everyone learns the same way. Quality stays high even with turnover.

**Grow Without Headaches**
Brooklyn Park works from day one. No rebuilding, no rebuying, no retraining.

## The Ask

You're already spending money on fragmented tools and outside vendors — likely more than you realize. That money could go toward:

- **One unified system** instead of five disconnected ones
- **Family support** instead of anonymous help desks
- **Custom-built tools** instead of generic software
- **Long-term partnership** instead of monthly subscriptions

The quarterly investment is comparable to what you're already spending. The difference is where it goes and what you get back.

## A Family Investment

This isn't about selling you software. It's about:

- Building something that makes Christina's run better
- Creating time for the things that actually matter
- Supporting your growth instead of complicating it
- Keeping the investment in family

The system is built. The training is ready. Brooklyn Park is supported from day one.

The only question is: are you ready to stop juggling and start running?
