## Executive Summary

The research reveals deep interconnections between circle practices, restorative justice, indigenous traditions, and African cultural epistemology. These connections form a global tapestry of communal approaches to healing, justice, and knowledge-making that stand in philosophical opposition to Western individualistic paradigms.

### Core Finding

Circle practices and restorative justice are not Western innovations but represent a reclaiming of global indigenous wisdom. From the palaver trees of West Africa to the talking circles of the Plains peoples, from the marae justice of the Maori to the Gacaca courts of Rwanda, human communities have developed remarkably consistent approaches to addressing harm through collective dialogue, truth-telling, and relationship repair.

### Key Themes

- **Relational over Retributive**: All traditions prioritize restoring relationships over punishment
- **Community as Primary Unit**: Individual harm is community harm; healing requires the collective
- **Elder Wisdom**: Elders serve as repositories of knowledge, tradition, and moral authority
- **Dialogic Process**: The spoken word has transformative power
- **Consensus-Based**: Outcomes emerge from collective agreement
- **Reintegration**: The goal is restoration, not exclusion

## Indigenous Roots of Circle Practices

### North American Indigenous Origins

Circle practices used in contemporary restorative justice have their most direct modern transmission through First Nations peoples of Canada and Native American tribes.

> "During the 1990s, members of First Nations in Canada began teaching the Circle practice to non-Native people. First Nation communities were seeking alternatives to the mass incarceration of their people, which was—and remains—another form of genocide."
> — Living Justice Press

#### Key Communities and Leaders

- **Hollow Water First Nation** (Manitoba, Canada): Demonstrated the philosophy and power of circles to address harms, particularly in healing from cycles of abuse
- **Carcross-Tagish and Dahka T'lingit First Nations**: Harold Gatensby, Phil Gatensby, and Mark Wedge trained many professionals in circle practices
- **Plains Peoples of North America**: The form of circles most commonly adapted in Western contexts reflects their talking circle traditions

#### Minnesota Connection

In Minnesota, Dakota-Ojibwe playwright and scholar Chuck Robertson was a strong advocate for using circles with Native and non-Native communities, especially in schools. With his circle associates Jamie Williams and Oscar Reed, Dr. Robertson trained hundreds of educators.

The Frogtown–Summit University Circle in Saint Paul operated for many years to support young African-American men, ages 18–35, demonstrating the cross-cultural applicability of these practices.

### Core Elements of Indigenous Circles

Traditional talking circles incorporate specific elements:

1. **Physical Arrangement**: Members sit in a circle
2. **Opening**: The circle starts with a prayer, usually by the convener or an elder
3. **Talking Piece**: A talking stick (or other sacred object like eagle feathers) is held by the speaker
4. **Directional Movement**: The talking piece passes to the left (clockwise)
5. **Respectful Listening**: Only the holder of the piece may speak; all others remain quiet
6. **Completion**: The circle is complete when the piece passes around without anyone speaking out of turn

### The Navajo Understanding

The Navajo term **hozhooji naat'aanii** captures the essence of these practices, meaning "people talking together to re-form relationships with each other and the universe." This emphasizes that circles are not merely procedural but cosmological—connecting participants to each other and to the broader web of existence.

### Circles Are a Way of Life

> "In these traditions, Circles are not a 'technique' or a set of instructions—they are a way of life, based on deeply held cultural values and relationships."
> — Living Justice Press

Indigenous Circle spaces and Westernized Circle spaces look and feel different; they are not the same. Different cultural philosophies and habits undergird each.

## African Traditional Justice and Ubuntu Philosophy

### Ubuntu as Foundational Philosophy

African approaches to justice share fundamental principles with Indigenous North American practices, though they developed independently.

> "In traditional Africa the concepts ubuntu, community, indigenous justice and restoration are interlinked and aimed at the restoration of victims and the reintegration of offenders back into the community. The restoration of relationships and social harmony undermined by the conflict are also of importance."

**Ubuntu** represents a world view that emphasizes interconnectedness—often expressed as **"I am because we are"** (Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu).

> "Ubuntu is an African philosophical tradition that embodies the ability of one human being to empathize with another. It is the quintessence of African humanism, communalism, and belonging."

### Key Principles of Ubuntu

1. **Interconnectedness**: Individual identity is constituted through relationships
2. **Communal Responsibility**: The community shares responsibility for individual behavior
3. **Restorative Focus**: Justice aims to heal, not to punish
4. **Collective Good**: Community welfare takes precedence over individual benefits
5. **Reconciliation**: The goal is restored relationships, not retribution

### The Palaver Tradition

One of Africa's most significant contributions to circle-based conflict resolution is the **palaver** (from Portuguese *palavra*, meaning "word" or "speech").

> "The palaver tree, present in diverse cultures from the Igbo and Yoruba in Nigeria to the BaKongo and Fang in Central Africa, and among the Shonas in Zimbabwe, functions as both a physical space and an epistemic practice for resolving disputes, sharing grievances, and restoring broken relationships."

#### Core Elements of Palaver

- **Oral negotiation**
- **Consensus-building**
- **Participation of elders and women**
- **Truth-telling for social restoration**

> "The palaver creates physical, social, and psychological space for open communication so that persons can be integrated into the life and expectations of their communities. Through the palaver African communities heal sickness, educate their members about moral standards, and reconcile enemies."

#### Three Palaver Commitments

1. **Open Communication**: Especially truth-telling
2. **Memory/Anamnesis**: Developing a shared sense of the past
3. **Communal Reconciliation**: Healing at the collective level

#### Palaver Locations

Different African cultures have specific locations for palaver:
- **Baoulé**: The *apatame* (traditional arbour) in front of the village chief's house
- **Fangs and Bulu (Central Africa)**: Inside a guardhouse known as *Aba*
- **Liberia**: Dedicated palaver halls at most villages

### African Restorative Mechanisms Across the Continent

#### Gacaca (Rwanda)

Derived from the Kinyarwanda word **umucaca** meaning "a plant so soft to sit on that people prefer to gather on it."

> "Gacaca gatherings were meant to restore order and harmony within communities by acknowledging wrongs and pursuing justice for the victim."

After the 1994 genocide, Rwanda revived and adapted this traditional practice:
- Over 12,000 community courts established
- Processed approximately 2 million cases
- Emphasized truth-telling, confession, and community service
- Locally elected judges (*inyangamugayo* - "persons of integrity")

#### Abunzi (Rwanda)

Meaning "those who reconcile," this mediation process:
- Brings parties together with community members
- Aims for amicable, mutually agreed resolutions
- Formally legalized in 2006
- Required as first step before formal courts

#### Ubushingantahe (Burundi)

- *Gushinga* means "to plant or fix"
- *Intahe* means "a stick"
- When pronouncing decisions, the elder plants a stick in the ground
- Parties take an oath before proceedings
- Celebration with banana or sorghum beer marks restoration of relationships

#### Mato Oput (Uganda)

A cleansing ceremony for reconciliation after serious offenses, involving:
- Ritual acknowledgment of wrongdoing
- Community witnessing
- Symbolic acts of cleansing and restoration

#### Xeer (Somalia)

A traditional legal system practiced by Somali clans:
- Governs land use, family disputes, and inter-clan relations
- Elders mediate based on clan codes
- Emphasizes negotiated settlements

### South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission

The TRC represented a national-scale application of Ubuntu principles:

> "Pardon rather than punishment, or pardon for the many alongside punishment of the few, has become a trend for transitional societies coming out of eras marked by intrastate conflict."

The TRC's slogan "Revealing is Healing" captured the Ubuntu understanding that truth-telling serves a therapeutic function.

## African Epistemology: Communal Knowledge Systems

### The Nature of Communal Knowledge

African epistemology fundamentally differs from Western individualistic approaches to knowledge.

> "In the traditional African view, knowledge is not acquired by labor but 'given' by the ancestors. Second, it is immediately social: not 'I' know, but 'we' know. Thirdly, knowledge is not universal but local tribal."

This is **African Communitarian Epistemology (ACE)**:

> "It studies the specific ways and means by which Africans arrive at, and justify their understanding of reality. Essentially, it is a social and communitarian epistemological system in which the community is the primary bearer and justifier of knowledge."

### Key Features of African Epistemology

1. **Collective Knowledge**: The community, not the individual, is the primary knower
2. **Testimonial Authority**: Elder testimony is a genuine source of knowledge
3. **Contextual Truth**: Knowledge is validated within specific community contexts
4. **Relational Understanding**: Knowledge exists within webs of relationships
5. **Practical Orientation**: Knowledge serves communal purposes

### Oral Tradition as Epistemological Framework

> "Oral tradition, which involves parables, proverbs, myths, art, and folklore, also involves relying on elders as the repositories of knowledge and tradition. This reliance can be justified based on the principles of epistemic trust, epistemic dependence, and epistemic communalism."

#### Components of Oral Tradition

- **Proverbs**: Condensed wisdom applicable to situations
- **Folktales**: Moral instruction through narrative
- **Myths**: Explanatory frameworks for existence
- **Riddles**: Cognitive training and cultural transmission
- **Songs and Poems**: Emotional and spiritual knowledge
- **Epic Histories**: Collective memory
- **Ceremonial Speeches**: Formal knowledge transmission

> "The elderly and the wise-men are regarded as the purveyors of the thought system. The study of African epistemology cannot be successfully carried out without an examination of how the African thought system is transferred from generation to generation."

### Consensus as Truth: The Akan Concept of Nokware

Among the Akan people, **nokware** (truthfulness) literally means "being of one mouth" or "being of one voice."

> "This oneness of voice refers to communal unanimity; so that the truth is that which is agreed to by the community."

This is not mere agreement but rather:
- Beliefs that correspond to shared experience
- Understanding validated through collective discernment
- Truth as relational and communal, not individual and abstract

### Sources of Knowledge in African Traditions

1. **Ancestral Knowledge**: Wisdom passed down through generations
2. **Elder Wisdom**: Accumulated experience of living elders
3. **Communal Discernment**: Collective assessment of situations
4. **Spiritual/Divine Knowledge**: Insights from the spirit world (accessed through rituals, dreams, divination)
5. **Practical Experience**: Learning through communal life and work

## The Maori Connection: Family Group Conferencing

### Origins and Influence

New Zealand's Family Group Conferencing (FGC), introduced in 1989 through the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act, represents another indigenous tradition influencing global restorative practice.

> "Traditional Maori concepts of conflict resolution strongly influenced the New Zealand model."

### Pre-Colonial Maori Justice

> "At its core, traditional Māori justice revolved around collective responsibility rather than individualizing blame. The driving aim was to restore the relational and spiritual balance disrupted by wrongdoing. This meant making amends not just to the victim, but to their whole family or tribe as well."

#### Key Elements

- **Collective Responsibility**: The extended family (*whānau*) shares responsibility
- **Relational and Spiritual Balance**: Justice restores cosmic harmony
- **Multi-Party Involvement**: Elders, tribal leaders, victim representatives, and offender's family all participate
- **Reintegration Focus**: Agreed-upon sanctions include restitution, apologies, and community service

### The Marae as Justice Space

The **marae** (communal meeting grounds) serves as the traditional site for Māori justice processes, especially in urban areas. Marae justice addresses:
- Sharing guilt
- Forgiveness and anger
- Real life circumstances, not just the technical crime

> "If you operate a whanau (extended family) everyone is equally important and the focus is on the group, not just the victim. Then you restore everything, including mana (personal dignity), as well as heal the offender."
> — Dr. Pita Sharples

### Critical Perspectives

Scholars have raised important critiques about how Western systems have sometimes appropriated these practices:

> "Far from being an exemplar of culturally appropriate justice practice, the forum is experienced by some Māori participants as one that encloses Indigenous culture and Indigenous participants within a Eurocentric, formulaic, and standardized process."

Key concerns include:
- Lack of adequate Maori representation in design and implementation
- State co-optation of indigenous practices
- Procedural standardization that loses cultural authenticity
- Continued overrepresentation of Māori in criminal justice system

## Healing Centered Engagement: Contemporary Synthesis

### Dr. Shawn Ginwright's Framework

Dr. Shawn Ginwright, professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education and CEO of Flourish Agenda, has developed **Healing Centered Engagement (HCE)** as a contemporary framework that explicitly connects indigenous and African traditions to youth development and educational practice.

> "Healing and well-being are rooted in indigenous and African traditions, and they are not new ideas, but we need to bring them to the forefront."

### Examples in Practice

> "Some examples of healing centered engagement can be found in healing circles rooted in indigenous culture where young people share their stories about healing and learn about their connection to their ancestors and traditions, or drumming circles rooted in African cultural principles."

### Key Principles of HCE

1. **Asset-Based**: Focus on what's right with young people, not what's broken
2. **Culturally Rooted**: Healing practices draw from cultural traditions
3. **Holistic**: Addresses spiritual, emotional, physical, and relational domains
4. **Political**: Addresses root causes and systemic issues, not just symptoms
5. **Collective**: Healing happens in community, not isolation
6. **Adult Healing**: Adults must heal alongside youth

### Beyond Trauma-Informed Care

Ginwright distinguishes HCE from trauma-informed care:

> "The term 'trauma informed care' didn't encompass the totality of his experience and focused only on his harm, injury and trauma... 'I am more than what happened to me, I'm not just my trauma.'"

HCE moves from asking "What happened to you?" to "What's right with you?" and "How can we build upon what's right for you so that you can have a positive impact on the world?"

## Key Philosophical Connections Across Traditions

### Shared Principles Across Indigenous and African Traditions

| Principle | Indigenous North American | African/Ubuntu | Maori |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------|-------|
| Primary Unit | Community/Tribe | Community/Village | Whānau/Hapū/Iwi |
| Justice Goal | Restore harmony | Restore relationships | Restore balance/mana |
| Process | Circle dialogue | Palaver dialogue | Hui/Whānau conference |
| Authority | Elders | Elders/Chiefs | Kaumātua (elders) |
| Decision Method | Consensus | Consensus | Consensus |
| Offender Treatment | Reintegration | Reintegration | Reintegration |
| Truth Function | Healing | Healing | Healing |

### Distinctions from Western Approaches

> "The palaver model is non-hierarchical, inclusive of authorities outside formal state structures, and sensitive to local cosmologies and oral knowledge systems. While liberal frameworks pursue justice through law and rights adjudication, the palaver system emphasises relational justice—the healing of social bonds over the protection of legal entitlements."

| Western Retributive | Indigenous/African Restorative |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Individual responsibility | Collective responsibility |
| Punishment | Restoration |
| State authority | Community authority |
| Professional expertise | Elder wisdom |
| Adversarial process | Dialogic process |
| Rule application | Consensus-seeking |
| Exclusion (prison) | Reintegration |
| Victim as witness | Victim as participant |

### Ontological Foundations

These traditions share fundamental ontological assumptions:

1. **Relational Ontology**: Being is constituted through relationships
2. **Cosmic Interconnection**: Humans exist within broader spiritual/natural order
3. **Temporal Continuity**: Ancestors, living, and future generations are connected
4. **Word as Power**: Speech has creative and healing capacity
5. **Community as Organism**: The community is a living whole, not a collection of individuals

## Implications for Educational Equity

### Connections to Educational Practice

These traditions offer profound implications for educational equity work:

#### 1. Circle Practices in Schools

Circle practices in schools are not merely "techniques" but embody entire philosophies about human relationships, knowledge, and healing that have ancient roots across multiple cultures. When implemented authentically, they:

- Create space for all voices
- Build community and belonging
- Address harm through restoration rather than punishment
- Honor cultural knowledge systems
- Develop social-emotional competencies through cultural practice

#### 2. Discipline and Justice

Traditional punitive school discipline reflects Western retributive assumptions. Indigenous and African approaches suggest alternatives:

- Community circles rather than isolation
- Restoration rather than punishment
- Family and community involvement
- Focus on understanding and healing, not just consequences
- Reintegration as the goal

#### 3. Knowledge and Curriculum

African communitarian epistemology challenges individualistic, competitive academic structures:

- Collective learning and assessment
- Elder and community knowledge as curriculum sources
- Oral tradition alongside written text
- Wisdom as the goal, not just information
- Knowledge in service of community

#### 4. Healing Organizations

For schools to become healing organizations, they must embrace:

- Collective responsibility for all members
- Attention to relationships as primary
- Truth-telling processes for addressing harm
- Cultural practices that restore connection
- Adult healing as prerequisite for student healing

### Considerations for Implementation

#### Authenticity Concerns

> "Far from being an exemplar of culturally appropriate justice practice, the forum is experienced by some Māori participants as one that encloses Indigenous culture and Indigenous participants within a Eurocentric, formulaic, and standardized process."

Avoid:
- Procedural compliance without cultural understanding
- Appropriation without Indigenous/African leadership
- Standardization that loses relational authenticity
- State co-optation of community practices

#### Essential Elements

For authentic implementation:

1. **Community Ownership**: Practices should emerge from and be led by the communities they serve
2. **Cultural Grounding**: Deep understanding of the philosophical foundations, not just techniques
3. **Relationship Primacy**: Relationships must be genuine, not procedural
4. **Elder/Community Involvement**: Authentic connection to wisdom keepers
5. **Ongoing Learning**: Continuous deepening of understanding
6. **Critical Reflection**: Awareness of power dynamics and appropriation risks
